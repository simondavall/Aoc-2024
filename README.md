### To run all 25 days: ###
1. Install .Net 10.0 sdk/runtime.
2. Navigate to the project root.
3. Execute the make file: 
```bash
make
```
or directly from the root using 
```bash
cd Aoc && dotnet build -c Release && ./bin/Release/net8.0/Aoc
```
This will build all days' projects in Release mode, and execute them.
The results will be displayed in the terminal window, with execution timings for each.

### To run an individual day: ###
1. Install .Net 10.0 sdk/runtime.
2. Navigate to the day (e.g. /Day01)
3. Execute the make file to build (Debug mode) and run: 
```bash
make
```
or directly from within a day root using (change Day$$ to the required day. E.g Day01) 
```bash
dotnet build -c Debug && ./bin/Debug/net8.0/Day$$ input.txt
```
Individual days are built and run in Debug mode to trigger assert statements that are not available in Release mode.
